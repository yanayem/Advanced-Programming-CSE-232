## How to Run the Code

1. **Save the file**
   - Rename your file to:
     ```
     Main.java
     ```

2. **Compile the code**
   - Open your terminal/command prompt in the folder where `Main.java` is located.
   - Run:
     ```bash
     javac Main.java
     ```

   - This will generate `Main.class` (Couse `Main.class` is public class).

3. **Run the program**
   - Execute:
     ```bash
     java Main
     ```

4. **Expected Output**


## ✅ Requirements
- A modern compiler (GCC / Clang / Java depending on course section)  
- VS Code / CLion / IntelliJ IDEA  
- Git (optional but recommended)  
- Basic understanding of programming fundamentals
